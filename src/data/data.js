      "Hello devs,\n\nA friend of mine had an idea of creating a website based off of his subreddit. My original thought on how to do this was to use Next.js because I have become familiar with it and want to learn it more (besides the point). Originally I pulled data from through json, realized that there is a posts limit, so I scratched that idea, I have been pondering around looking into the Reddit API, I haven't been able to find much about using it with Javascript/other js frameworks, most of it is people pulling json data (which won't work for our idea), can anyone help me with ideas on how to accomplish this by using Next.js? Is it possible for me to use the Reddit API in a non Python stack? Or will I have to use Python for this idea? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo elaborate more about the idea, we want to have a web application based on the subreddit, pulling new and old posts directly from the subreddit, while having posts being made through our website and users, etc. I've been having some creative blocks lately when it comes to developing so a few ideas could help me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.",
