However, i finished just lesson 0 and lesson 1 and feel like it is kind of tough since he is giving us tons of new information quickly and i don’t know how much of these codes i should’ve retained. When i try to write a code i need to go back to the screenshots i took every second. What do you guys think i should do?

I barely know things related to coding and thought that this course would teach me cs50 efficiently and i can go on to learn python. However, i finished just lesson 0 and lesson 1 and feel like it is kind of tough since he is giving us tons of new information quickly and i don’t know how much of these codes i should’ve retained. When i try to write a code i need to go back to the screenshots i took every second. What do you guys think i should do? Continue this course or learn the same language from another source or just learn another language?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Does anyone have any idea how to make it so VS code saves my data in the debugger post crash so I can see what went wrong?

Hope you're well. \n\nI'm used to program frontends but in my master's thesis I need to create a (pretty big, in my opinion) backend, so my knowledge is still limited in these matters. So the question is: Having just the information about the endpoints, what's the best strategy to programmatically generate data to load test (using jmeter for instance) the application? (Not only generate the data but also the jmeter config to use that data, but this is less important). The idea here is to have a list of endpoints as input and return a jmeter configuration file as output, ready to be used.\n\nThanks in advance!",
